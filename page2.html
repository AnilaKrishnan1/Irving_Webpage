  <p>The Irving Convention Center at Las Colinas represents the innovative future of meetings and events. With almost 100,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space, the building’s unique architecture, vertical design, and interior finishes create a new niche in the marketplace. </p>
  <p>Ideally situated on 40 acres in the heart of Irving’s Las Colinas Urban Center, the Irving Convention Center is just one phase of a mixed-use entertainment district that includes a 350-room Westin Convention Center Hotel, and the $173 Million entertainment complex, the Toyota Music Factory, which is anchored by an 8,000-seat indoor/outdoor amphitheater operated by Live Nation.
